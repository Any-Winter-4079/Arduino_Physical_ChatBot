The robot connections are shown in the diagram below.

It is strongly recommended to build and test the robot piece by piece (e.g. [02_chassis_and_motors](02_chassis_and_motors.md)) rather than assembling everything at once. This allows for easier troubleshooting and ensures each component is working correctly before continuing with the next part.
